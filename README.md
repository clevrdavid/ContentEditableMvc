# ContentEditableMvc
ContentEditableMvc is a small library for ASP Core MVC web pages that lets you use the power of the HTML5 contenteditable attribute and Ajax to update content from the client.

This has been updated to work with ASP .NET Core.

The DLL can be used within a project in conjunction with the CSS & JS files to allow content editable controls to be used in place of standard ASP controls.

The drop-down behaviour has been improved to work with select lists derived from database queries.

This was updated to work with a specific project I am working on. I needed it to work with .NET Core. If I find the time in the future I will create a nuget package and better readme.
